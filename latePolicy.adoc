=== Late Policy

Because practice is so important for learning skills, we will do frequent 
exercises, assignments, and quizzes throughout the term.

The purpose of this work is to give you hands on experience with the topics
from class. Most of this work will be due in lecture or labs. *The  
weekly time commitment for this course is aimed to be approximately 10 hours per week, 
including lectures and labs.*

Assignments will generally be due on Fridays. However, you may request up to *one* late 
day (until Saturday) if necessary. No submissions beyond Saturday will be accepted.
This allows us time to grade assignments. And it helps prevent you from falling 
behind. Note that with weekly assignments, you can miss a week or two without losing 
much credit on a final grade. 

If you require an accommodation for exams and quizzes, this must be submitted 
to the instructor within the first two weeks or class.
