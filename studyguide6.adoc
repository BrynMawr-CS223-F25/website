  int balance;
};

void *Transfer(void *args){
  struct account** accounts = (struct account**) args;

  for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&fromAcct->lock);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&toAcct->lock);

    fromAcct->balance -= 25;
    toAcct->balance += 25;

    pthread_mutex_unlock(&fromAcct->lock);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&toAcct->lock);
  }

  return NULL;
}

int main() {

  // create accounts for A and B
  struct account accountA;
  struct account accountB;
  accountA.balance = 100;
  accountB.balance = 50;
  pthread_mutex_init(&accountA.lock, NULL);
  pthread_mutex_init(&accountB.lock, NULL);
  printf("Starting balances:\n");
  printf("\tA: %d\n", accountA.balance);

3) The following multi-threaded program attempts to count the numbers in a list.

* Which data is shared between threads?
* Which data is only accessed by a single thread?
* Which data is shared only between main and a single thread?
* When the list size is greater than 1000 the program isn't working correctly. What is going on and how can we fix it?

  gen_ptr = &x;  // gen_ptr can be assigned the address of an int
  gen_ptr = &ch; // or the address of a char (or the address of any type)

  int* int_ptr;

* What are some examples of primary storage?

        total += array[i];
        if (debug) {

    if (i == 0) {
      strcpy(test, "hello!");
    }
  }

== Compiling and linking

* What is the difference between compiling and linking?
* What is a library? When would you use one?
* What are differences between an application and a library?
* What is the difference between static and dynamic libraries? Why might you want to use one over the other?
* What does the pre-processor do?
* What is the purpose of compiling and linking?
* What is the difference between a header file (.h) and an implementation file (*.c)? 

1) Tymothy would like to create a library for creating color pallettes. The
functions in their library would have the following APIs. 

[source]
----
struct ppm_pixel {
  union {
    struct {
      unsigned char red;
      unsigned char green;
      unsigned char blue;
    };
    unsigned char colors[3];
  };
};

// Creates and initializes a pallet with the given number of random colors
struct ppm_pixel* create_pallette(int size);

// Frees the memory associated with the given pallette
void delete_pallette(struct ppm_pixel* pallette);
----

* How can Tymothy use `ar` to create a static library?
* How can Tymothy use `gcc` to create a shared library?
* How might Tymothy implement the given functions?
* Are the commands for building a library different
* How can Tymothy use the functions in their library? Write a program that tests the pallet function.
