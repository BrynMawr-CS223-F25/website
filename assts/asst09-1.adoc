= {title}

// *Due Wednesday, April 5, before midnight*

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement multi-thread algorithms using the pthread library

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Search

In the file, `search.c`, implement a program that uses N threads to search for a value in a list. 
Your program should load the binary file `data.bin` and then split the workload between the N threads.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make search**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror search.c -o search -lpthreads
$ **./search 2**
Enter a value to search: **3**
Thread 2 found 3 at index 5003
$ **./search 2**
Enter a value to search: **5003**
Thread 1 found 5003 at index 3
$ **./search 2**
Enter a value to search: **-2**
Not found!
----

Requirements:

* Your program should load the _binary_ file, `data.bin`. This file stores a sequence of non-sorted integers. The first value in the file holds the number of integers. link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec10/readbinary.c[This class example shows how to read in binary data]. Your program should read the first integer to get the size, malloc an array with the given size, and then read in the data as a big block.
* Your program should split the work of searching through the data between each thread.



= Threaded Mandelbrot

Implement a multi-threaded version of the mandelbrot set that you implemented for link:asst09.html[Assignment 09].

In the file, `thread_mandelbrot.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of the mandelbrot 
set. You have been given basecode that initializes the following values from command line arguments. This code uses the link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getopt-function-in-c-to-parse-command-line-arguments/[getopt function].

Arguments:

* `-s <size>` the image width and height
* `-l <xmin>` the leftmost coordinate, e.g. minimum x value
* `-r <xmax>` the rightmost coordinate, e.g. maximum x value
* `-t <ymin>` the topmost coordinate, e.g. minimum y value
* `-b <ymax>` the bottommost coordinate, e.g. maximum y value

When you run your program, you should get the output such as the following

$ **make thread_mandelbrot**
$ **./thread_mandelbrot**
Generating mandelbrot with size 480x480

Computed mandelbrot set (480x480) in 0.143906 seconds
Writing file: mandelbrot-480-1650116924.ppm
----

Requirements and hints:

* You can re-use your PPM and mandelbrot functions from A09. You should re-use your implementation for read/write PPM as well.
* Create four threads. Each thread should process a quadrant of the image.
* Print the ids and work tasks for each thread. You can print either the pthread_t ID, or your own given id. Above, we print the pthread_t ID. See the code from class for examples.
* Allocate an array of pixels using malloc and then save the final image using `write_ppm`.
* Do not declare global variables! Use parameters to send data to each thread's start_routine.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. The performance should be comparable to your multi_mandelbrot version from A09.
* Your output filename should have the format `mandelbrot-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* Set a random seed to ensure that the color palette is different each time, e.g. `srand(time(0))`
