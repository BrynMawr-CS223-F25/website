= {title}

Code Due Friday, April 25th, before midnight. 

Written work Due Thursday, April 24th, in class. **Written portion is due April 24th - no late work accepted**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Understand void* types and pointer arithmetic
* More linked list practice
* Better understand malloc and free, particularly the use of the free list

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Description

In this assignment, we will implement our own version of malloc and free based on 
"first-fit" strategy and analyze its behavior. 

For this assignment, you should submit both 

* your code, and
* a written report, *due in class*

= Code setup

Your basecode includes the following source files

* `mylloc_list.c` - Malloc/free implementation that implements a free list with first-fit strategy (corresponds to `mhysa.c` in reading)
* `rand.c` - Utilities for generating random sizes of memory
* `sbrk.c` - Utilities for extending the amount of memory allocated to a program
* `memstats.c` - A benchmark program
* `unit_tests.c` - Unit tests for your malloc/free implementation 

NOTE: This assignment is based on the reading: "My malloc: mylloc and mhysa" by
Johan Montelius, posted to Slack. You should complete the reading and finish the
implementation of `mylloc_list.c` _before_ starting the assignment. 

= mylloc_list

In `mylloc_list.c`, implement malloc and free based on the reading.

Recall that the reading steps you through implementing your own malloc/free
based on a free list and a _first-fit_ strategy.  This implementation uses a
header to keep track of the memory requested from `sbrk`.  When we re-use memory
that is freed, we typically will not re-use the entire block of memory. Modify
the implementation from the reading to 

* Extend this header to keep track of both the requested size and the amount of memory 
currently used in the chunk.

[source]
----
struct chunk {
  int size; // size of memory allocated from sbrk
  int used; // *NEW*: amount currently in use
  struct chunk *next;
};
----

Use the unit tests included with your assignment to test that your implementation is correct

= Visualizing memory allocations

**This part of the assignment should be submitted in hard-copy - due April 24th**

Consider the output from the following program. This program makes a series of malloc/free calls based on random 
sizes of memory. In this question, you will visualize the execution of malloc and free 
from the previous question.

Below, we explain the first block of memory allocations (Round 1). 
When the program starts, we have no buffers allocated and the free list is empty.

After the first 3 allocations, the buffers and free list look as follows:

image:memstats1.png[]

After the next iteration, we have

image:memstats2.png[]

After the next iteration, we have
image:memstats3.png[]

After the next iteration, we have
image:memstats4.png[]

At the end of round 1, the buffers and free list look as follows

image:memstats5.png[]

Answer the following questions:

. Why is the total memory allocated equal to 2769 bytes?
. If the total memory is equal to 2769 bytes, why did the heap increase by 2849 bytes?
. Why is the underutilized memory 12%?
. Draw the buffers and free list after round 1
. Draw the buffers and free list after round 2

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (2 points) mylloc_list
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (1.9 points) passes all tests
* (2 points) Readme

NOTE: valgrind won't work for this assignment. You do not need to check for memory errors on this assignment.

// TODO: Next smemester: get students to use valgrind header!!!`

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
