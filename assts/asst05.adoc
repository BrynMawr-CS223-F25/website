= Crossword

Implement a program, `crossword.c`, that generates a crossword using two words from 
a user. Your program should create a 2D array of characters to hold your crossword puzzle. 
Your algorithm should identify a common letter between the given words and list one word 
vertically and the other word horizontally. If there is no common letter, print a message and quit.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make crossword**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror crossword.c -o crossword
$ **./crossword**
Usage: ./crossword <word1> <word2>
$ **./crossword elephant onion**
. e . . . 
. l . . . 
. e . . . 
. p . . . 
. h . . . 
. a . . . 
o n i o n 
. t . . . 
$ **./crossword elephant zoo**
No common letter!
----

Requirements/Hints:

* You must store the crossword in a dynamically allocated array.
* Use malloc and free to allocate a 2D array to store the grid.
* Your program must use command line arguments!
* Your program should print the results so that the words are properly aligned.
* For extra challenge, try to support more than two words!

NOTE: To read in link:https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/advanced_cmd_line_args.html#_c_cmd_line_args_[command line arguments], define main with argc and argv parameters 
as follows. The first command line argument is always the program name. `argc` is 
the number of arguments. You can use `atoi` and `atof` to convert from strings 
to numeric types (int and float respectively)
[source]
----
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 3) {
    printf("Usage: %s <word1> <word2>\n", argv[0]);
    exit(0);
  }
  // todo: your code here
  return 0;
}

= PPM

Implement two functions, `read_ppm` and `write_ppm`, that read and write binary PPM files. 
This functions are implemented in the file `load_ppm.h` and tested using code in `test_ppm.c`.

== Background

link:http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html[PPM (Portable Pix Map)]
 is an image file format that stores the colors of an image as a 2D array of 
colors. Each color is represented as a RGB triplet, representing red, green and blue respectively. 
The properties of the image, such as its size and color format, are specified at the start of the 
file (called its "header information"). PPM supports both ASCII (plain text) and binary data (raw). 

NOTE: We will write a funtion that *reads PPM files in binary format*!

For example, consider the following image

image::https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~soni/cs35/f13/Labs/images/01/example5000.png[]

//In ASCII format, the above image is stored as follows. To see for yourself, do `cat feep-ascii.ppm`.
//[source]
//----
//P3
//# This is a comment
//4 4
//255
//0  0  0   100 0  0       0  0  0    255   0 255
//0  0  0    0 255 175     0  0  0     0    0  0
//0  0  0    0  0  0       0 15 175    0    0  0
//255 0 255  0  0  0       0  0  0    255  255 255
//----

The above image contains a 4x4 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is a triplet of red-blue-green (RGB) color 
values, each stored as an `unsigned char`. Unsigned chars have values which range from 0 to 255, where 
smaller values correspond to darker colors. The triplet (0,0,0) corresponds to black. The triplet 
(255,255,255) cooresponds to white. The triplet (255,0,0) corresponds to red. This system of colors is called 
the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model[RGB Color Model] and it is a common standard for 
representing colors on a computer. 

The RGB colors for the pixels in the above image are as follows

[source]
----
(0,0,0)      (100,0,0)    (0,0,0)     (255,0,255)
(0,0,0)      (0,255,175)  (0,0,0)     (0,0,0)
(0,0,0)      (0,0,0)      (0,15,175)  (0,0,0)
(255,0,255)  (0,0,0)      (0,0,0)     (255,255,255)
----

In binary format (also called _raw_ format), the image is stored as follows. 
To see for yourself, do `hexedit feep-raw.ppm`.

The leftmost column is byte number in hexidecimal. For example, 0x18 is 24 in decimal. There are 24 bytes
on the first row on output. The rightmost column displays the raw data in ASCII, using `.` for non-visible 
ASCII codes, such as '\0' and 'Escape'.

Regardless of format, every PPM file starts the following information in its header. 

* A "magic number" indicating the type of PPM. Binary types start with "P6".
* Whitespace  (blanks, tabs, \n, \r, etc)
* Width and height as ASCII decimal integers (separated by whitespace)
* Maximum color value as an ASCII decimal integer. *You can assume the Maxval is less than 256, meaning each RGB value is 1 byte.*
* A single whitespace character
* A raster (e.g. the array of pixels) of Height number of rows and Width number of columns, in order from top to bottom. 

PPM images may contain comments in their header. These must be on their own line and start with the symbol `#`.

NOTE: The header information is always in plain text. It is only the pixel data that differs between ASCII and raw formats. 

NOTE: PPM files can be viewed using tools such as Photoshop and Gimp.

== Read PPM

For this question, you will implement a function, `read_ppm()`, that can read
PPM files stored in _binary_ format. This function should take a filename as input
and return a 2D array of `struct pixel`. A `struct pixel` has the following definition

[source]
----
struct ppm_pixel {
    unsigned char red;
    unsigned char green;
    unsigned char blue;
};
----

The user of the function `read_ppm` is reponsible for freeing the memory allocated by this function.

You will re-use this function throughout the semester. For this reason, we place its implementation
in it's own file, `read_ppm.c`, and use a header file, `read_ppm.h`, to include it in our main application.

You may implement your 2D array of pixels as either a flat array or an array or
arrays. For example, if you return a flat array, your function should be defined
as `struct ppm_pixel* read_ppm(const char* filename, int* width, int* height)`.
If you return an array or arrays, your function should be defined as  `struct
ppm_pixel** read_ppm(const char* filename, int* width, int* height)`. In both cases, 
use the parameters `width` and `height` to return the width and height of the image.

In the file, `test_read.c`, write a short test that calls your function and prints the
contents of `feep-raw.ppm` like so:

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make test_read**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror test_read.c read_ppm.c -o test_read
$ **./test_read**
Testing file feep-raw.ppm: 4 4
(0,0,0) (100,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,0,255)
(0,0,0) (0,255,175) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)
(0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,15,175) (0,0,0)
(255,0,255) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,255,255)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Your function should return NULL if the filename is invalid
* Your function should return NULL if memory cannot be allocated for the image data
* Your function should return a pointer to the array you create in read_ppm
* You can assume that it is safe to read the header line by line (e.g. using `fgets`).
* Don't forget to free your data!
* Do not modify read_ppm.h. And do not remove the version of the function you do not implement!
* Make sure your program compiles using the Makefile
* You can assume the PPM file has a single comment line, starting with `#`


== Write PPM

Implement a new function, `write_ppm`, defined in `write_ppm.c`. 
Similarly to link:asst04.html[Assignment 04], you should choose one definition of `write_ppm` to 
implement, depending on whether you use either a "flat array" or an "array of arrays" to store your pixels. 

In the file, `test_write.c`, write a short test that reads in `feep_raw.ppm` and then writes it to 
a file `test.ppm` by calling your function. Then, read in `test.ppm` and print the contents. 
If it is working correctly, you will see the following pixel values.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make test_write**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror test_write.c write_ppm.c read_ppm.c -o test_write
$ **./test_write**
Testing file feep-raw.ppm: 4 4
(0,0,0) (100,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,0,255)
(0,0,0) (0,255,175) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)
(0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,15,175) (0,0,0)
(255,0,255) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,255,255)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Use `fprintf` to write the header and `fwrite` to write the binary Data to your file.
* Do not modify write_ppm.h. And do not remove the version of the function you do not implement!
* Make sure your program compiles using the Makefile
* Don't forget to write the header comment!
