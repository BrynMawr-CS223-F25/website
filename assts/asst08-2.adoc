// **Due Wednesday, March 29, at midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement an algorithm using multiple processes with fork()
* Compare single- and multi-process implementation performance
* Work with fork(), wait(), process ids, and shared memory

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Search

In the file, `search.c`, implement a program that uses two processes to search for a value in a list. 
Your program should use `fork()` to spawn a child process and then split the workload between the 
parent and the child.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make search**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror search.c -o search
$ **./search**
Enter a value to search: **3**
Child found 3 at index 5003
Not found!
$ **./search**
Enter a value to search: **5003**
Not found!
Parent found 5003 at index 3
$ **./search**
Enter a value to search: **-2**
Not found!
Not found!
----

Requirements:

* Your program should load the _binary_ file, `data.bin`. This file stores a sequence of non-sorted integers. The first value in the file holds the number of integers. link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec10/readbinary.c[This class example shows how to read in binary data]. Your program should read the first integer to get the size, malloc an array with the given size, and then read in the data as a big block.
* Your program should split the work of searching through the data between the parent and child process.

= Multi-Mandelbrot

In the file, `multi_mandelbrot.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of
the mandelbrot set using multiple processes spawned with `fork()`.  Your
basecode implements the same command line arguments in with `single_mandelbrot`. 
You should use the same algorithm you used to compte `single_mandelbrot`.

Your program should use `shared memory` to split the computation of the image across 
4 child processes. After each child completes, the parent process should save the 
result to a file using `write_ppm`.

image::A09-multi.png[height=400]

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM functions from A06. 
* Allocate an array of pixels using *`shared memory`* and then save the final image using `write_ppm`. link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec20/shm_fork.c[Use this example from class as a reference.]
* Print the pids and work tasks for each child.
* Use `fork()` to create 4 child processes and `wait()` to wait for each to complete.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. 
* Your output filename should have the format `multi-mandelbrot-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* Set a random seed to ensure that the color palette is different each time, e.g. `srand(time(0))` 
* In your `README.adoc`, compute images with sizes of 100, 400, 800, 1000, and 2000 using both your single process and multi process implementations. Record the number of seconds it takes to compute each image.

== Cleaning up leaked shared memory files

If a program does not detatch and remove a shared memory file, the system can 
run out of shared memory resources. We can clean up these files manually. 

To check for shared memory files on your system, run the command `ipcs`

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ipcs -m**

_______ shared Memory Segments ________
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status

0x00000000 7          alinen     644        41         0
---- 

To remove a shared memory file, run the command `ipcrm -m <shmid>`.

We have given you a script, link:shm_cleanup.sh[`shm_cleanup.sh`], that will remove all shared 
memory files on your system.
