= {title}

**Due Friday, March 21, at midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Gain experience working with `fork()`.
* Use OS system calls in your C program. 
* Implement a multi-process program

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Warm-up

In the file, `warmup.c`, implement a program that spawns processes according to the following diagram.

----
$ **make warmup**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror warmup.c -o warmup
$ **./warmup**

17301] Bye
17300] C0
17300] Bye
17302] C1
17302] Bye

Requirements:

* Your program should print the messages as shown above.
* Your program should use fork() to spawn processes.
* Call `getpid()` to show the process ids for each print message.

= Grep

In the file, `grep.c`, implement a program that implements grep using multiple processes.

NOTE: You can print with colors to the console using ANSI escape sequences (see below). 
For example, `printf(ANSI_COLOR_GREEN "Green Text" ANSI_COLOR_RESET);` will print green text. link:https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/mg/ansicolors/index.html[Here is a good guide!]

[code]
----
// Helpful macros for working with color
#define ANSI_COLOR_RED     "\x1b[31m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_GREEN   "\x1b[32m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_YELLOW  "\x1b[33m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_BLUE    "\x1b[34m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_MAGENTA "\x1b[35m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_CYAN    "\x1b[36m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_RESET   "\x1b[0m"

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (1 points) Warmup
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) prints correct messages, uses `fork()` and `getpid()`
** (0.5 points) no memory errors
* (1 points) Grep
* (2 points) Spellchecker

NOTE: When using `readline()`, valgrind will report that some of your memory is
_still reachable_. This memory is not leaked. It hasn't been cleaned up yet from 
`readline()`'s internal memory. For example, output such as the following is ok
[code]
----
==3504== HEAP SUMMARY:
==3504==     in use at exit: 204,143 bytes in 221 blocks
==3504==   total heap usage: 453 allocs, 232 frees, 244,790 bytes allocated
==3504==
==3504== LEAK SUMMARY:
==3504==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==3504==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==3504==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==3504==    still reachable: 204,143 bytes in 221 blocks
==3504==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
