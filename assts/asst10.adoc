*Due Friday, April 4th, before midnight*

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement a program that uses signals to coordinate between two processes
* Implement an embarrassingly parallel multi-threades algorithms using the pthread library


[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Marco Polo

In the file, `marco_polo.c`, implement a program that uses signals to coordinate between two processes, like so. 

. When the user presses the 'm' key, the parents sends SIGALRM. 
. When the child receives SIGALRM, the child prints "Marco" and sends SIGALRM to the parent.
. When the parent receives SIGALRM, the parent prints "Polo".

You can use strace to track the signals sent between the the parent and the child.

----
$ **strace -e 'trace=!all' -f ./marco_polo**
Parent is 738
strace: Process 739 attached
**m**
[pid   739] --- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=738, si_uid=1000} ---
Marco [739]
[pid   738] --- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=739, si_uid=1000} ---
Polo [738]
**m**
[pid   739] --- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=738, si_uid=1000} ---
Marco [739]
[pid   738] --- SIGALRM {si_signo=SIGALRM, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=739, si_uid=1000} ---
Polo [738]
**q**
[pid   739] --- SIGTERM {si_signo=SIGTERM, si_code=SI_USER, si_pid=738, si_uid=1000} ---
[pid   739] +++ killed by SIGTERM +++
--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_KILLED, si_pid=739, si_uid=1000, si_status=SIGTERM, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---
+++ exited with 0 +++
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Use `fork` to create a parent and child process.
* Use `kill` to send signals between the parent and the child.
* Register two signal handlers, one for the parent and one for the child. Configure the signal handler to trigger when it receives SIGALRM.
* The child process should say "Marco". The parent process should respond with "Polo".
* In the parent, implement a loop that responds to commands from the user, specifically
** 'm' should send the initial signal that triggers the child to say "Marco"
** 'q' should send quit the application. This command should also send SIGTERM to the child, so the child also exits.

= Grep

This question implements a simplified version of the bash command `grep`. Grep searches a list of files 
for a given keyword or expression. For example, the following command searches for the keyword `public` 
in a list of source files. We use the `find` command to generate the list of source files to search.

NOTE: Make sure you include the backticks, e.g. `` ` ``. This adds the filenames found by `find` as command line arguments to `grep`.

In the file, `grep.c`, implement a program that uses N threads to search for a keyword 
in a set of files. 

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make grep**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror grep.c -o grep -lpthreads
$ **./grep**
usage: ./grep ``<``NumThreads``>`` ``<``Keyword``>`` ``<``Files``>``
----

// Backticks can be written with `` ` ``
image::thread-grep.png[width=500px]

Requirements:

* Your program should take the number of threads, keyword, and a list of files as command line arguments
* Subdivide the files among the N threads. Note that the number of files may not divide evenly between threads.
* Print the totals and sub-division of files similarly to the output above
* Use the `fgets` to process the lines in each file
* Use the function `strstr` defined in `string.h` to search lines of text for the keyword. link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strstr[Documentation is here]

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (2 points) Marco Polo
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.9 points) Implementation satisfies requirements and works correctly.
** (1.0 points) no memory errors
* (2 points) Grep
** (0.15 points) style and header comment
** (0.1 points) Correct command line arguments: number of threads, keyword, and a list of files
** (0.2 points) Subdivide the files among the N threads
** (0.3 points) Correct output
** (0.75 points) no memory errors

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
