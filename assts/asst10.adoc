= {title}

*Due Friday, March 28th, before midnight*

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement multi-thread algorithms using the pthread library

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Threaded Renderer 

In the file, `render.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image using a procedural 
algorithm. You have been given basecode that initializes the following values from command line arguments. This code uses the link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getopt-function-in-c-to-parse-command-line-arguments/[getopt function].

Arguments:

* `-s <size>` the image width and height
* `-l <xmin>` the leftmost coordinate, e.g. minimum x value
* `-r <xmax>` the rightmost coordinate, e.g. maximum x value
* `-t <ymin>` the topmost coordinate, e.g. minimum y value
* `-b <ymax>` the bottommost coordinate, e.g. maximum y value

When you run your program, you should get the output such as the following

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make render**
$ **./render**
Generating mandelbrot with size 480x480
  X range = [-2.0000,0.4700]
  Y range = [-1.1200,1.1200]
Computed mandelbrot set (480x480) in 0.323261 seconds
Writing file: render-480-1649001071.ppm
----

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM functions from previous assignments. 
* Allocate an array of pixels using malloc and then save the final image using `write_ppm`.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. 
* Your output filename should have the format `render-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* (Optional) Set a random seed to ensure that colors are randomized (if you randomize colors)

for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      xfrac = row / image_size
      yfrac = col / image_size
      x0 = xmin + xfrac * (xmax - xmin)
      y0 = ymin + yfrac * (ymax - ymin)

      write color to image at location (row,col)

= Threaded Render

Implement a multi-threaded version of the image you computed for the previous question.

In the file, `thread_render.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image using the same 
algorithm as before.  You have been given basecode that initializes the following values from command line arguments. This code uses the link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getopt-function-in-c-to-parse-command-line-arguments/[getopt function].

Arguments:

* `-s <size>` the image width and height
* `-l <xmin>` the leftmost coordinate, e.g. minimum x value
* `-r <xmax>` the rightmost coordinate, e.g. maximum x value
* `-t <ymin>` the topmost coordinate, e.g. minimum y value
* `-b <ymax>` the bottommost coordinate, e.g. maximum y value

When you run your program, you should get the output such as the following

[source,subs="quotes"]

$ **make thread_render**
$ **./thread_render**

----

Requirements and hints:

* You should re-use your PPM functions from previous assignments. 
* Create four threads. Each thread should process a quadrant of the image.
* Print the ids and work tasks for each thread. You can print either the pthread_t ID, or your own given id. Above, we print the pthread_t ID. See the code from class for examples.
* Allocate an array of pixels using malloc and then save the final image using `write_ppm`.
* Do not declare global variables! Use parameters to send data to each thread's start_routine.
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. The performance should be comparable to your multi_mandelbrot version from A09.
* Your output filename should have the format `render-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.

= Performance comparison

Compare the performance between the single and threaded rendered versions. Fill in `Readme.adoc` 
with your hardware specifications and runtime statistics.

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
