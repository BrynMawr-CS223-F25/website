*Due Friday, April 4th, before midnight*

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement multi-thread algorithms using the pthread library
* Use mutex and barrier to coordinate between different threads

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/master`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Fractal Flame

In the file, `fractal.c`, compute a program that outputs a PPM image of a fractal computed 
with the algorithm below. 

Computing the fractal requires three steps:

* First, determine counts for the number of times each point visits a pixel, using the given formula
* Second, you must turn the counts from step 2 into a color. The final colors should be written to a 2D array of ppm_pixel (either flat or an array of arrays) and then written. 

Each of the above steps can be parallelized using threads. The second step will require a mutex to ensure that the counts are set correctly. Below are suggested algorithms for 
computing each step. 

**Step 1: Compute visited counts**
[source]
----
for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      if (row,col) belongs to the mandelbrot set, continue

      xfrac = row / image_size
      yfrac = col / image_size
      x0 = xmin + xfrac * (xmax - xmin)
      y0 = ymin + yfrac * (ymax - ymin)

      x = 0
      y = 0
      while (x*x + y*y < 2*2)

        yrow = round(size * (y - ymin)/(ymax - ymin))
        xcol = round(size * (x - xmin)/(xmax - xmin))
        if (yrow < 0 || yrow >= size) continue; // out of range
        if (xcol < 0 || xcol >= size) continue; // out of range

        increment count at (yrow, xcol) 
        update max count
----

**Step 3: Compute colors**
[source]
----
gamma = 0.681
factor = 1.0/gamma
for each row in the image
   for each col in the image
      value = 0

      if counts at (row,col) are greater than zero
        value = log(counts[row][col]) / log(max_count)
        value = pow(value, factor)

      color.red = value * 255
      color.green = value * 255
      color.blue = value * 255

      write color to image at location (row,col)    
----

Each thread should compute the three steps on a quadrant of the image. Below 
is a suggested outline for your thread's start routine.

[source]
----
void * start(void* data) {

  // perform step 1

  // use a thread barrier to wait for all threads to finish steps 1 and 2
  // perform step 2

}

Requirements and hints:

* Each thread should run all steps on a quadrant of the image. 
* You will need a `pthread_barrier_t` to wait for all counts to be computed before computing the colors
* Use mutex to compute the counts
* You should output the number of seconds needed to compute the image. Use this link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS223-S22/class-examples/blob/main/lec17/matrix.c[class example, matrix.c] for an example. 
* Your output filename should have the format `fractal-<size>-<timestamp>.ppm`. The timestamp can be obtained by calling `time(0)`.
* You may use global variables for this program.

//NOTE: Other chaotic sets can be visualized in the same way as the Buddhabrot. To see more, read about link:https://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf[Fractal Frames].

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (4 points) Threaded Fractal
** (0.4 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) Generated image with correct filename
** (0.2 points) Supports given command line arguments
** (1.0 points) Correct output, thread coordination, and output performance statistics
** (2.0 points) no memory errors

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
