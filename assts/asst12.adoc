= {title}

Due Friday, December 6th, before midnight. **Written portion is due December 5th - no late work accepted**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Understand void* types and pointer arithmetic
* More linked list practice
* Better understand malloc and free, particularly the use of the free list

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/master`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Description

In this assignment, we will implement our own version of malloc and free based on 
"first-fit" strategy and analyze its behavior. 

For this assignment, you should submit both 

* your code, and
* a written report, *due in class*

= Code setup

Your basecode includes the following source files

* `mylloc_list.c` - Malloc/free implementation that implements a free list with first-fit strategy (corresponds to `mhysa.c` in reading)
* `rand.c` - Utilities for generating random sizes of memory
* `sbrk.c` - Utilities for extending the amount of memory allocated to a program
* `memstats.c` - A benchmark program
* `unit_tests.c` - Unit tests for your malloc/free implementation 

NOTE: This assignment is based on the reading: "My malloc: mylloc and mhysa" by
Johan Montelius, posted to Slack. You should complete the reading and finish the
implementation of `mylloc_list.c` _before_ starting the assignment. 

= mylloc_list

In `mylloc_list.c`, implement malloc and free based on the reading.

Recall that the reading steps you through implementing your own malloc/free
based on a free list and a _first-fit_ strategy.  This implementation uses a
header to keep track of the memory requested from `sbrk`.  When we re-use memory
that is freed, we typically will not re-use the entire block of memory. Modify
the implementation from the reading to 

* Extend this header to keep track of both the requested size and the amount of memory 
currently used in the chunk.

[source]
----
struct chunk {
  int size; // size of memory allocated from sbrk
  int used; // *NEW*: amount currently in use
  struct chunk *next;
};
----

Use the unit tests included with your assignment to test that your implementation is correct

= Memory statistics

In `memstats.c`, implement the function `memstats` to print the following information

* The total number of memory blocks allocated by malloc, along with
** The number of total blocks which are currently in-use 
** The number of total blocks which are currently free 
* The total amount of memory allocated by malloc, along with
** The total amount of memory currently in-use 
** The total amount of memory currently free 
* The amount of underutilised memory as a percentage. This is the percent of memory that has been allocated by `sbrk` but not being used by the application.

For example, your function might produce the following output

[source]
----
Total blocks: 8 Free blocks: 6 Used blocks: 2
Total memory allocated: 9665 Free memory: 4427 Used memory: 5238
Underutilized memory: 0.48
----

You are given code to simulate many random allocations and frees. After
implementing your function, you should get the following output.

== README (*Due in class as a hardcopy*)

Read this section and answer the corresponding questions. We will visualize the execution of `memstats.c` for Round 1.
When the program starts, we have no buffers allocated and the free list is empty. 

image:memstats0.png[]

After the first 3 allocations, the buffers and free list look as follows:

image:memstats1.png[]

After the next iteration, we have

image:memstats2.png[]

After the next iteration, we have
image:memstats3.png[]

After the next iteration, we have
image:memstats4.png[]

At the end of round 1, the buffers and free list look as follows

image:memstats5.png[]

Answer the following questions:

. Why is the total memory allocated equal to 2769 bytes?
. If the total memory is equal to 2769 bytes, why did the heap increase by 2849 bytes?
. Why is the underutilized memory 12%?
. Draw the buffers and free list after round 1
. Draw the buffers and free list after round 2

// TODO: Next smemester: get students to use valgrind header!!!`

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
