= {title}

**Due Friday, February 14th, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Use malloc and free
* Work with pointer-based data structures
* Use gdb and valgrind. 

**All programs must run without memory errors and leaks!**

:sectnums:

= Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Magic Square

Implement a program, `magic_square.c`, that tests whether a given matrix is a magic square. 
A link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square[magic square] is an N by N matrix where each 
row, column, and diagonal has the same sum, called the _magic constant_.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make magic_square**
gcc -g magic_square.c -o magic_square
$ **./magic_square < magic1.txt**
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
M is a magic square (magic constant = 15)
$ **./magic_square < magic2.txt**
9 1 6
3 5 7
4 8 2
M is NOT a magic square!
$ **./magic_square < magic3.txt**
1
M is a magic square (magic constant = 1)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Read in the matrix from stdin using `scanf(" %d", &val);`. The first two values are the dimensions of the matrix. All subsequent integers are the values of the matrix. 
* Use malloc and free to allocate a 2D array to store the inputs.

= Sorted Snacks

Implement a program, `sorted_snackbar.c`, that allows users to add snacks to the snackbar and displays 
them in alphabetical order. Your program should have the same features as last week's snackbar, but should 
use a _linked list_ to store the snacks, rather than an array. 

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make sorted_snackbar**
gcc sorted_snackbar.c -o sorted_snackbar
$ **./sorted_snackbar**
Enter a number of snacks: **3**
Enter a name: **Slurm**
Enter a cost: **1.50**
Enter a quantity: **3**
Enter a name: **Beans**
Enter a cost: **5**
Enter a quantity: **1**
Enter a name: **Carrots**
Enter a cost: **2**
Enter a quantity: **10**

Welcome to Sorted Sally's Snack Bar.

0) Beans                cost: $5.00     quantity: 1
1) Carrots              cost: $2.00     quantity: 10
2) Slurm                cost: $1.50     quantity: 3
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Implement the function `insert_first`. This function should create a new snack struct and insert it at the beginning of the list. 
* Implement the function `clear`. This function should clear and free all items in the list.
* Implement the function `printList`. This function should print the contents of the list.
* Implement three sort functions: `sortCost` and `sortName` and `sortQuantity`. These functions should sort by the given attribute. 

= Submit your Work

Before submitting, check that

* Your programs run on goldengate using the `make` command!
* valgrind does not report any errors!

Push you work to github to submit your work.

$ git status
$ git add *.c

$ git commit -m "{ASST} complete"

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (2 points) Magic Square
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) reads in matrix from stdin
** (0.5 points) creates/deletes 2D matrix using malloc/free
** (1.0 points) No memory errors
* (2 points) Sorted Snacks
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) defines a struct correctly handles deletion and insertion to a linked list
** (0.5 points) correctly sorts and displays snacks based on name, cost, or quantity
** (1.0 points) handles file and linked list nodes correctly (no memory errors!)

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
