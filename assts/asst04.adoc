**Due Thursday, Oct 6, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Work with files
* Deepen our understanding of data types
* Work with malloc/free
* Work with 2D arrays

**All programs must run without memory errors and leaks!**

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/master`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Background: PPM

link:http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html[PPM (Portable Pix Map)]
 is an image file format that stores the colors of an image as a 2D array of 
colors. Each color is represented as a RGB triplet, representing red, green and blue respectively. 
The properties of the image, such as its size and color format, are specified at the start of the 
file (called its "header information"). PPM supports both ASCII (plain text) and binary data (raw). 

We will write a funtion that *reads PPM files in binary format*!

For example, consider the following image

image::https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~soni/cs35/f13/Labs/images/01/example5000.png[]

//In ASCII format, the above image is stored as follows. To see for yourself, do `cat feep-ascii.ppm`.
//[source]
//----
//P3
//# This is a comment
//4 4
//255
//0  0  0   100 0  0       0  0  0    255   0 255
//0  0  0    0 255 175     0  0  0     0    0  0
//0  0  0    0  0  0       0 15 175    0    0  0
//255 0 255  0  0  0       0  0  0    255  255 255
//----

The above image contains a 4x4 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is a triplet of red-blue-green (RGB) color 
values, each stored as an `unsigned char`. Unsigned chars have values which range from 0 to 255, where 
smaller values correspond to darker colors. The triplet (0,0,0) corresponds to black. The triplet 
(255,255,255) cooresponds to white. The triplet (255,0,0) corresponds to red. This system of colors is called 
the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model[RGB Color Model] and it is a common standard for 
representing colors on a computer. 

The RGB colors for the pixels in the above image are as follows

[source]
----
(0,0,0)      (100,0,0)    (0,0,0)     (255,0,255)
(0,0,0)      (0,255,175)  (0,0,0)     (0,0,0)
(0,0,0)      (0,0,0)      (0,15,175)  (0,0,0)
(255,0,255)  (0,0,0)      (0,0,0)     (255,255,255)

In binary format (also called _raw_ format), the image is stored as follows. 
To see for yourself, do `hexedit feep-raw.ppm`.

The leftmost column is byte number in hexidecimal. For example, 0x18 is 24 in decimal. There are 24 bytes
on the first row on output. The rightmost column displays the raw data in ASCII, using `.` for non-visible 
ASCII codes, such as '\0' and 'Escape'.

Regardless of format, every PPM file starts the following information in its header. 

* A "magic number" indicating the type of PPM. Binary types start with "P6".
* Whitespace  (blanks, tabs, \n, \r, etc)
* Width and height as ASCII decimal integers (separated by whitespace)
* Maximum color value as an ASCII decimal integer. *You can assume the Maxval is less than 256, meaning each RGB value is 1 byte.*
* A single whitespace character
* A raster (e.g. the array of pixels) of Height number of rows and Width number of columns, in order from top to bottom. 

PPM images may contain comments in their header. These must be on their own line and start with the symbol `#`.

NOTE: The header information is always in plain text. It is only the pixel data that differs between ASCII and raw formats. 

NOTE: PPM files can be viewed using tools such as Photoshop and Gimp.

= Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Matching braces 

Implement a program, `match_braces.c`, that takes a filename as a command line
argument and uses a stack to check for matched braces and report any errors.

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make match_braces**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror match_braces.c -o match_braces
$ **./match_braces**
usage: ./match_braces <filename>
$ **./match_braces prog.c**
Cannot open file: prog.c
$ **./match_braces prog1.c**
Found matching braces: (21, 32) -> (23, 5)
Found matching braces: (25, 30) -> (28, 9)
Found matching braces: (17, 53) -> (29, 5)
Unmatched brace on Line 31 and Column 1
Found matching braces: (40, 47) -> (43, 5)
Found matching braces: (36, 18) -> (47, 1)
Unmatched brace on Line 34 and Column 34
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Implement the functions `push`, `pop`, `clear`. Implementing `print` is also recommended to help you debug your assignment.
* Use to input the filename. 
* Print the usage if the user inputs an incorrect number of command line arguments
* Print an error if your program cannot open the file
* Use `fgetc` to read the file one character at a time. Update the current line number when you encounter `\n`. Update the current column as you read in each character. 
* To check for matched braces, push to the stack when you encounter a '{' and then pop from the stack when you encounter '}'. If the symbols pushed and popped do not match, there is an error. 
* The output of the program should match the line and column numbers that VS Code reports when you check for matched braces. 

NOTE: To open and read the file, use a file pointer (FILE*). See link:https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/IO.html#_file_inputoutput[File Input/Output] for examples.


= Read PPM

For this question, you will implement a function, `read_ppm()`, that can read
PPM files stored in _binary_ format. This function should take a filename as input
and return a 2D array of `struct pixel`. A `struct pixel` has the following definition

[source]
----
struct ppm_pixel {
    unsigned char red;
    unsigned char green;
    unsigned char blue;
};
----

The user of the function `read_ppm` is reponsible for freeing the memory allocated by this function.

You will re-use this function throughout the semester. For this reason, we place its implementation
in it's own file, `read_ppm.c`, and use a header file, `read_ppm.h`, to include it in our main application.

You may implement your 2D array of pixels as either a flat array or an array or
arrays. For example, if you return a flat array, your function should be defined
as `struct ppm_pixel* read_ppm(const char* filename, int* width, int* height)`.
If you return an array or arrays, your function should be defined as  `struct
ppm_pixel** read_ppm(const char* filename, int* width, int* height)`. In both cases, 
use the parameters `width` and `height` to return the width and height of the image.

In the file, `test_ppm.c`, write a short test that calls your function and prints the
contents of `feep-ascii.ppm` like so:

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make test_ppm**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror test_ppm.c read_ppm.c -o test_ppm
$ **./test_ppm**
Testing file feep-raw.ppm: 4 4
(0,0,0) (100,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,0,255)
(0,0,0) (0,255,175) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)
(0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,15,175) (0,0,0)
(255,0,255) (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (255,255,255)
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Your function should return NULL if the filename is invalid
* Your function should return NULL if memory cannot be allocated for the image data
* Your function should return a pointer to the array you create in read_ppm
* You can assume that it is safe to read the header line by line (e.g. using `fgets`).
* Don't forget to free your data!

= ASCII Art

When I was a kid, my mom used to bring home dot-matrix printouts of ascii art
for my sister and I to use as coloring books. 

image:ascii-snoopy.jpg[]

For this question, write a program, `ascii_image.c`, that takes a PPM image as a 
command line argument and displays it as 
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art[ASCII Art].  

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make ascii_image**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror ascii_image.c read_ppm.c -o ascii_image

== Algorithm

Step 1: For each RGB pixel in the image, compute the average intensity as follows

[stem]
++++
I = \frac{1}{3}(R + G + B)
++++

Step 2: Then, assign an ASCII character based on the intensity

[.center,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Intensity | Symbol

| 0-25 | @
| 26-50 | #
| 51-75 | %
| 76-100 | *
| 101-125 | o
| 126-150 | ;
| 151-175 | :
| 176-200 | ,
| 201-225 | .
| 226-255 | <space>
|===
