**Due Friday, February 14th, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Use malloc and free
* Work with pointer-based data structures
* Use gdb and valgrind. 

**All programs must run without memory errors and leaks!**

= Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.


= Most danceable

Implement a program, `danceable.c`, that allows users to easily access the most 
danceable songs in `songlist.csv`. 

NOTE: Unlike last week, `songlist.csv` *does not* contain the number of songs in the file!
The format of the CSV file is as follows, containing a line for the header followed by all songs.
[source]
----
Title, Artist, Duration (ms), Danceability, Energy, Tempo, Valence
Canned Heat,Jamiroquai,331760,0.7,0.865,128.04,0.78
....
----

Your program should re-use the code to load songs from a CSV file *except* instead of 
storing the songs in an array, your program should store the songs in a linked list.

When the user asks for the most danceable song, your program should find the song with 
the highest danceability, show the user its information, and then delete it from the 
linked list.

Requirements/Hints:

* Implement helper functions for printing, removing nodes, clearing the list, and inserting to the list.
* Make sure your program runs without memory leaks (check with valgrind!)
* Make sure to handle the case where the list is empty.
* Make sure to clean up your memory if the list is non-empty when the user quits!

= Submit your Work

Before submitting, check that

* Your programs run on goldengate using the `make` command!
* valgrind does not report any errors!

Push you work to github to submit your work.

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (4 points) Most danceable
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) defines a struct, reads and parses songlist.csv correctly, and has correct user input
** (1.5 points) correctly handles deletion and insertion to a linked list
** (2.0 points) handles file and linked list nodes correctly (no memory errors!)

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
