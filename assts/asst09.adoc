= {title}

**Due Friday, March 21, at midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Gain experience working with `fork()`.
* Use OS system calls in your C program. 
* Implement a multi-process program

[discrete]
== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Warm-up

In the file, `warmup.c`, implement a program that spawns processes according to the following diagram.

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make warmup**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror warmup.c -o warmup
$ **./warmup**
17300] A0
17300] B0
17301] B1
17301] Bye
17300] C0
17300] Bye
17302] C1
17302] Bye
----

Requirements:

* Your program should print the messages as shown above.
* Your program should use fork() to spawn processes.
* Call `getpid()` to show the process ids for each print message.

= Grep

In the file, `grep.c`, implement a program that uses N processes to search for a keyword 
in a set of files. 

Your program implements a simplified version of the bash command `grep`. Grep searches a list of files 
for a given keyword or expression. For example, the following command searches for the keyword `public` 
in a list of source files. We use the `find` command to generate the list of source files to search.
For example:

image::grep.png[width=500px]

NOTE: Make sure you include the backticks, e.g. `` ` ``. This adds the filenames found by `find` as command line arguments to `grep`.


[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make grep**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror grep.c -o grep 
$ **./grep**
usage: ./grep ``<``NumProcesses``>`` ``<``Keyword``>`` ``<``Files``>``
$ **./grep 1 class missing.txt**
Searching 1 files for keyword: class
Process [613] searching 1 files (3 to 4)
Process [613] Error: Cannot open file
Total occurances: 0
Elapsed time is 0.000608
----

// Backticks can be written with `` ` ``
image::grep_fork.png[width=500px]

Requirements:

* Your program should take the number of processes, keyword, and a list of files as command line arguments
* Subdivide the files among the N processes. Note that the number of files may not divide evenly between processes.
* Print the totals and sub-division of files similarly to the output above
* Use the `fgets` function to process the lines in each file
* Use the function `strstr` defined in `string.h` to search lines of text for the keyword. link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strstr[Documentation is here]
* To compute the total count, each child process can return the number matching lines using its exitcode. Recall that the parent can use the status reported by `waitpid` to get the children's exit code. 
* Your program should report the amount of time needed to search using `gettimeofday`

NOTE: You can print with colors to the console using ANSI escape sequences (see below). 
For example, `printf(ANSI_COLOR_GREEN "Green Text" ANSI_COLOR_RESET);` will print green text. link:https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/mg/ansicolors/index.html[Here is a good guide!]

[code]
----
// Helpful macros for working with color
#define ANSI_COLOR_RED     "\x1b[31m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_GREEN   "\x1b[32m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_YELLOW  "\x1b[33m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_BLUE    "\x1b[34m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_MAGENTA "\x1b[35m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_CYAN    "\x1b[36m"
#define ANSI_COLOR_RESET   "\x1b[0m"

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (1 points) Warmup
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) prints correct messages, uses `fork()` and `getpid()`
** (0.5 points) no memory errors
* (3 points) Grep

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
