*Due Friday, April 18 before midnight (No late submissions accepted)*

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement multi-threaded algorithms using the pthread library
* Implement a tree data structure
* Work with OS system calls

== Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line, make sure that you have the correct upstream repository and do a fetch upstream to get the basecode for this assignment.

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.

= Grep

This question implements a simplified version of the bash command `grep`. Grep searches a list of files 
for a given keyword or expression. For example, the following command searches for the keyword `public` 
in a list of source files. We use the `find` command to generate the list of source files to search.

image::grep.png[width=500px]

NOTE: Make sure you include the backticks, e.g. `` ` ``. This adds the filenames found by `find` as command line arguments to `grep`.

In the file, `grep.c`, implement a program that uses N threads to search for a keyword 
in a set of files. 

[source, subs="quotes"]
----
$ **make grep**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror grep.c -o grep -lpthreads
$ **./grep**
usage: ./grep ``<``NumThreads``>`` ``<``Keyword``>`` ``<``Files``>``
----

// Backticks can be written with `` ` ``
image::thread-grep.png[width=500px]

Requirements:

* Your program should take the number of threads, keyword, and a list of files as command line arguments
* Subdivide the files among the N threads. Note that the number of files may not divide evenly between threads.
* Use a mutex to ensure that threads do not interrupt each others printing
* Print the totals and sub-division of files similarly to the output above
* Use the `fgets` to process the lines in each file
* Use the function `strstr` defined in `string.h` to search lines of text for the keyword. link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strstr[Documentation is here]

= Code Analysis

This question has two parts. In the first part, you will implement a search tree with string keys. 
In the second part, you will use the tree to store the source files from a directory, along with their 
dependency information. Similarly to your `grep` implementation, you will build the tree using multiple 
threads.

== Tree

In the file, `tree.c`, implement a binary search tree. Do not change the header
`tree.h`, nor the function declarations in `tree.c`. But you can add functions to `tree.c`! 
We recommend using the book
"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C" by Mark Allen Weiss. See the
link:../index.html[course webpage for a link].

$ **make ./tree_tests**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-but-set-variable tree_tests.c tree.c -o tree_tests -lpthread
$ **./tree_tests** 
Running tests...
test 1: insert for empty tree: PASSED
test 2: name set correctly: PASSED
test 3: left is null: PASSED
test 4: right is null: PASSED
test 5: name set correctly: PASSED
test 6: right is null: PASSED
test 7: name set correctly: PASSED
test 8: item not in tree: PASSED
test 9: item in tree: PASSED
test 10: found correct object: PASSED

Requirements:

* You must not modify the basecode for `tree.h` or `tree.c`, except to add functions to `tree.c`
* Your output should match the above and pass all tests

== Dependencies

A _dependency_ is a general software term for any software required by another. In this question, 
we will store files in a binary search tree so we can list their file dependencies, 
as determined by `#include` statements. For example, 
the file "Animal.h" depends on "Locomotion.h". 

//We can represent such dependencies using a graph, where 
//nodes represent files and directed edges represent dependencies. With this representation, a node 
//with no outgoing edges has no dependencies.  

In the file, `dependency.c`, implement a program that uses N threads to build a binary search tree of a 
given set of files. After building the tree, the program should give the user a prompt where they 
can list the processed files in alphabetical order and then query the dependencies of the file by 
giving the filename.  

//The nodes of the binary search tree should also contain a list of dependencies that 
//point to other nodes in the tree. This data structure should make it easy to look up a file by name and 
//then trace through the dependencies between files.

Requirements:

* Check that a file is valid before adding it to the tree
* Support the commands: quit, list, <filename>
* Use a mutex to avoid race conditions when setting up the tree
* Your program should take the number of threads and a list of files as command line arguments
* Subdivide the files among the N threads. Note that the number of files may not divide evenly between threads.
* Use a mutex to ensure that threads do not have a race conditions when constructing the tree
* Use `strstr` and `fgets` to parse the source file and find lines containing `#include`
* Strip the filenames from the `#include` lines when printing dependencies.

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
