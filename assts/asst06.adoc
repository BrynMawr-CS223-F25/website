**Due Friday, February 28, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Work with pointer-based data structures
* Strengthen C programming with strings and files

:sectnums:

= Update your repository

Do a *fetch upstream* to obtain the basecode for this assignment. 

Using the command line

* Open terminal and change your current directory to your assignment repository.
* Run the command `git fetch upstream`
* Run the command `git merge upstream/main`

Your repository should now contain a new folder named `{ASST}`.

The `fetch` and `merge` commands update your repository with any changes from the original.


= Matching braces 

Implement a program, `match_braces.c`, that takes a C file as a command line
argument and uses a stack to check for matched braces. If not all braces are matched, 
print the line where a mis-matched brace occurs.

----
$ **make match_braces**
gcc -g -Wall -Wvla -Werror match_braces.c -o match_braces
$ **./match_braces**
usage: ./match_braces <filename>
$ **./match_braces prog.c**
Cannot open file: prog.c
$ **./match_braces prog1.c**
Found matching braces: (21, 32) -> (23, 5)
Found matching braces: (25, 30) -> (28, 9)
Found matching braces: (17, 53) -> (29, 5)
Unmatched brace on Line 31 and Column 1
Found matching braces: (40, 47) -> (43, 5)
Found matching braces: (36, 18) -> (47, 1)
Unmatched brace on Line 34 and Column 34
----

Requirements/Hints:

* Use your linked list implementation as a starting point.
* Implement the functions `push`, `pop`, `clear`. Implementing `print` is also recommended to help you debug your assignment.
* Use command line arguments to input the filename. 
* Print the usage if the user inputs an incorrect number of command line arguments
* Print an error if your program cannot open the file
* Use `fgetc` to read the file one character at a time. Update the current line number when you encounter `\n`. Update the current column as you read in each character. 
* To check for matched braces, push to the stack when you encounter a '{' and then pop from the stack when you encounter '}'. If the symbols pushed and popped do not match, there is an error. 
* The output of the program should match the line and column numbers that your editor (such as VS Code) reports when you check for matched braces. 

NOTE: Unlike last week, you need to open the files as text data. See link:https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/IO.html#_file_inputoutput[File Input/Output] for examples.


= Tree

In the file, `tree.c`, implement a binary search tree. Do not change the header
`tree.h`, nor the function declarations in `tree.c`. But you can add functions to `tree.c`! 
We recommend using the book
"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C" by Mark Allen Weiss. See the
link:../index.html[course webpage for a link].

Running tests...

test 5: name set correctly: PASSED
test 6: right is null: PASSED

Requirements:

* You must not modify the basecode for `tree.h` or `tree.c`. You may add functions to `tree.c`
* Your output should match the above and pass all tests

= Dependencies

A _dependency_ is a general software term for any software required by another. In this question, 
we will store files in a binary search tree so we can list their file dependencies, 
as determined by `#include` statements. For example, 
the file "Animal.h" depends on "Locomotion.h". 

In the file, `dependency.c`, implement a program that builds a binary search tree of a 
given set of files. After building the tree, the program should give the user a prompt where they 
can list the processed files in alphabetical order and then query the dependencies of the file by 
giving the filename.

----

Requirements:

* Check that a file is valid before adding it to the tree
* Support the commands: quit, list, <filename>
* Your program should take a list of files as command line arguments. The `find` command computes this list of files. 
* Use `strstr` and `fgets` to parse the source file and find lines containing `#include`
* Strip the filenames from the `#include` lines when printing dependencies.

= Submit your work

Push you work to github to submit your work.

= Grading Rubric

*Assignment rubrics*

Grades are out of 4 points.

* (2 points) matched braces
** (0.2 points) style and header comment
** (0.8 points) correct output and behavior, supports command line arguments
** (1.0 points) no memory errors
* (1 points) Tree
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) implements all functions, passes all tests and does not modify basecode
** (0.5 points) no memory errors
* (1 points) Dependencies
** (0.1 points) style and header comment
** (0.4 points) Correct behavior
** (0.5 points) no memory errors

*Code rubrics*

For full credit, your C programs must be feature-complete, robust (e.g. run without memory errors or crashing) and 
have good style.

* Some credit lost for missing features or bugs, depending on severity of error
* -5% for style errors. See the link:../codingstandard.html[class coding style] here.
* -50% for memory errors
* -100% for failure to checkin work to Github
* -100% for failure to compile on linux using make
