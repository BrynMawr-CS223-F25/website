=== Labs, quizzes, exams

Labs and Quizzes are mandatory. No credit is possible for missed quizzes.  If
you must miss a quiz, you must make arrangements to take the quiz at another
time BEFORE the scheduled quiz. If you miss a quiz for medical reasons, you must
provide a doctor's note.  

Labs will consist of hands-on practice in teams, alternating each week between 
written exercises and timed coding sessions. Coding sessions will be graded and 
count towards your quiz grade. Worksheets count towards your participation grade. 

There will be one final exam for the semester. Details and dates will be
released during the semester.  Please read the section on
link:#_accommodations[accommodations] if you are in need of extra time.  You
must inform us of accommodations or conflicts at least 2 weeks in advance of
the exam.

Quizzes and exams will be closed book. You may bring a single, hand written cheat sheet 
with you.
