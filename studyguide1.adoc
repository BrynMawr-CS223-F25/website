Quizzes will be closed book. 30 minutes in lab.

Topics:

* Programming in C
* Data types and sizes
* UNIX commands
* Function stacks
* Basic arrays

Write C programs to check your answers. Or you can ask a TA or instructor 
to give feedback on your responses.

= Practice questions

1) What is the minimum size of the following structures?

[source]
----
struct Snack {
  char name[32];
  int quantity;
  float cost;
};
----

Hint: To check your answers, use the `sizeof()` function.

2) Consider navigating directories from the command prompt in UNIX. Suppose you are in your home directory. 

* How would you create a subdirectory with name `foo`?
* How would you see the contents of your `.bashrc` file?
* How would you list the contents of `foo`?
* How can you create a file in the directory `foo` called `test.c`?
* How can you compile a c program? 

3) Suppose Willa is in their home directory, `/home/willa`. Write commands to produce the following directory structure.
Willa contains two sub-directories, A ad B, and one file `hello.c`. B contains a sub-directory C and file `test.txt`. 
Below is a visualization of it where child directories are indented. 

[source]
----
\home\willa
  A
  B
    C
    test.txt
  hello.c
----

4) When Willow runs her program from the command line, she gets the following error? What is happening and how can she fix it?

[source]
----
$ ls
Makefile  fortune  fortune.c  hello  hello.c
$ hello
Command 'hello' not found
----

5) The following program crashes. What is the problem and how can we fix it?

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int* value = NULL;
  int a = 4;

  printf("value is %d\n", *value);
}
----

6) The following program crashes. What is the problem and how can we fix it?

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void initialize(char text[]) {
  strcpy(text, "pina collada");
}

int main() {
  char str1[5];
  initialize(str1);
  printf("%s\n", str1);
  return 0;
}
----

7) What is the output of this program?

[source]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int arg_modifier(int x, int *y);

int main() {
    int val1, val2, ret;

    printf("Enter a value: ");
    scanf("%d", &val1);
    printf("Enter another value: ");
    scanf("%d", &val2);

    // pass val1 by value and val2 by pointer:
    printf("before call: val1 = %d val2 = %d\n", val1, val2);
    ret = arg_modifier(val1, &val2);
    printf("after call:  val1 = %d val2 = %d ret = %d\n", val1, val2, ret);

    return 0;
}

int arg_modifier(int x, int *y) {
    printf("  in arg_modifier:      x = %d *y = %d\n", x, *y);
    *y = *y + x;
    x = x + 5;
    printf("  leaving arg_modifier: x = %d *y = %d\n", x, *y);

    // Draw function stack here
    return x;
}
----

8) Draw the state of the function stack and heap for the program above in `arg_modifier`. Assume the 
user entered the values 6 and 1.  Draw the stack at the point in the execution
right before the return from the arg_modifier function, and consider the
following questions:

* Where are variables val1 and val2 located on the stack?
* Where are the parameter values located?
* What value does each parameter get?
* What variables are in scope of `arg_modifier`?

9) Consider the following code. Find and fix the errors in the associated stack diagram.

[source]
----
float foo(float* vals, int n)
{
  float x = 0.0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    x += vals[i];
  }
  return x;
}

void main()
{
  float heights[3] = {6.1f, 5.2f, 4.9f};
  float a = foo(heights, 3);
  float b = a / 3;
  // draw stack here
  printf("%.2f\n", b);
}
----

10) Write code that implements a power function (for positive integer exponents only). 
A call to your function should compute stem:[base^{exp}] and might look like:

[source]
----
result = power(base, exp);
----

11) Write code that implements a function `void removeLetter(char* str, char letter)` that removes all occurrences of `letter` 
from `str`. Your function should modify the contents of str. (To check your work, implement your program and test it from `main`).

12) Write code that implements a function `isPalindrome` that returns 1 if a given string is a palindrome and 0 otherwise. 
Your function can be iterative or recursive. Test your function from `main`.
